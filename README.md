# STAR WARS SURVEY
In this project we will be cleaning and exploring the data set ["star_wars.csv"](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/star-wars-survey/StarWars.csv) collected by 
the team FiveThirtyEight. They surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey 
and received 835 total responses. The data has several columns containing answers to questions 
about the Star Wars movies.
We will tackle the following issues first and then look for answer to some questions:
* Rename the columns by assigning them more meaningful names.
* Clean and change the format/type of the certain columns to make the analysis easier.
* Find the rating of each star wars episode and based on respondent preferences.
* How many people have watched each movie in the series?
* Are there differences between genders?
* See the differences between the Star War fans and non-fans 
* Variability in each education category
* Favoribility of top Star Wars movie characters
